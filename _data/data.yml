    assignments:
      - title: Coral
        link: /assets/images/coral-presentation.pdf
        tagline: "Coral is a loose acronym for core application launcher. It is front-end platform 
          built in VueJS. The platform focuses on principles of coupling/cohesion dynamics with the main goal being
          a reduction in effort duplication. The platform provides things like login (SSO), authorization, componentry,
          routing, asset chunking, unit testing, etc. Coral is a huge project that I continue to develop. My main focus
          now is onboarding new developers into the system."

      - title: myGeneHistory
        link: "https://www.mygenehistory.com"
        tagline: "myGeneHistory is a SPA written in VueJS that helps healthcare providers identify and test their 
          patients' at risk for hereditary cancer. The app uses a RESTful API to provide many features like societal guideline
          recommendations. One thing I love about myGeneHistory is the unit testing coverage. Vue test utils and Jest was 
          implemented in the beginning and now we have over 600 unit tests with over 90% code coverage. The app also integrates
          with our provider portal (MyriadPro) to faciliate ordering by pre-populating orders."

      - title: MyriadPro
        link: "https://www.myriadpro.com/resultsnow"

          handling routing and template generation."

        tagline: "An Angular SPA used to quickly draw a family history pedigree. This app is preferred over many paid
          pedigree drawing applictions by Myriad's own Genetic Counselor's. The app uses GoJS to draw the actual pedigree
          in an HTML canvas."

        link: "https://webapps.myriad.com/find-provider/"
        tagline: "A PHP/jQuery app that uses Myriad's provider database and Google Maps API to find health care providers
          based on lat/long coordinates. I worked with our CRM team to populate the provider datavase with lat/long 
          coordinates and then created a RESTful API to lookup providers based on distance from a user provided location.
          The app has been repurposed several times across the organization for various business units."
