    assignments:
      - title: Coral
        link: /assets/images/coral-presentation.pdf
        tagline: "Coral is a loose acronym for core application launcher. It is front end platform 
          built in VueJS. The platform focuses on principles of coupling/cohesion dynamics with the main goal being
          a reduction in effort duplication. The platform provides things like login (SSO), authorization, componentry,
          routing, asset chunking, unit testing, etc. Coral is a huge project that I continue to develop. My main focus
          now is onboarding new developers into the system."

        link: "https://www.mygenehistory.com"
        tagline: "myGeneHistory is a SPA written in VueJS that helps health care providers identify and test their 
          patients' at risk for hereditary cancer. The app uses a RESTful API to provide many features like societal guideline
          recommendations. One thing I love about myGeneHistory is the unit testing coverage. Vue test utils and Jest was 
          implemented in the beginning and now we have over 600 unit tests with over 90% code coverage. The app also integrates
          with our provider portal (MyriadPro) to facilitate ordering by pre-populating orders."

        link: "https://www.myriadpro.com/resultsnow"

        tagline: "An Angular SPA used to quickly draw a family history pedigree. This app is preferred over many paid

          in an HTML canvas."

        link: "https://webapps.myriad.com/find-provider/"
        tagline: "A PHP/jQuery app that uses Myriad's provider database and Google Maps API to find health care providers
          based on lat/long coordinates. I worked with our CRM team to populate the provider database with lat/long 
          coordinates and then created a RESTful API to lookup providers based on distance from a user provided location.
          The app has been repurposed several times across the organization for various business units."
